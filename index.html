          <p class="intro">
            Alph@bet is a font series of NFTs that connects the past and the
            distant with the present and the near; connecting all times and all
            places to the here and now where we are in reality.<br />
            Alph@bets itself is finite, mapped to each individual is infinite.
            And provides the richest space for imagination.<br />
            Memory and imagination are not separate from each other, both are
            committed to penetrating deeply into the other, and words are the
            key to combining the two.

          <p class="intro">
            "Alph@bet" is not 26 isolated letters, where you can freely choose
            and combine nicknames that are memorable for you. It can be your
            family's friend's, your car's, your pet's name, a book that is
            meaningful to you, your nft (BAYC), your punks<br />
            Letters are just a tool used to activate the mind. Their uniqueness
            lies in finding a way to feel the intuition of everything in the
            world and to express emotional energy.<br />
            The vision is to build a type art community, as well as bring more
            attention to equally niche and obscure professions, and support
            independent artists.<br />
            The power of individual letters may be limited, but the power of
            language united by letters is unlimited. A community of individual
            "I's" can do amazing things as well.<br />
            And finally, bring diversity to the NFT community!

            Hi, I'm kzizib and I've been doing visual design and typography for
            brands for the past 6 years. Always obsessed with Fibonacci series
            and grid systems, which are the core tools of my creativity. Also
            have a wide range of interests and love solving puzzles.<br />I love
            fonts of all kinds, from traceable sans serifs to mysterious
            Egyptian symbols, which have always been magical to me. I entered
            the Morisawa Type Design Competition with my teacher and won a gold
            medal. I am forever learning. <br />With the advent of Non-Fungible
            Token, I knew something was about to change. As a designer, I deeply
            believe that NFT is an effective way to provide real-world benefits
            in a non-traditional way.

          <p class="intro">
            Hi I'm Ryan. I'm kzizib's college classmate, majoring in interaction
            design. We learn from each other and do our graduation design
            together. After graduation, worked for a while and still exploring
            different career paths. Drawing knowledge from different
            industries.<br />
            In my free time, completed my first novel and finished the
            illustrations myself. In a sense, I am a perfectionist. Only when my
            work is up to the standard I think it should be, will I upload it.
            So my output is not very efficient, less is more isn't it? haha.<br />
            In 2020, I discovered the field of NFT and prepared for it, and now
            I can't wait for the adventures ahead.
