            Alph@bet is a literal series of NFTs that connects the past and the
            distant with the present and the near; connecting all times and all
            places to the here and now where we are in reality.<br />
            Alph@bets itself is finite, mapped to each person is infinite. And
            provides the richest space for imagination. Memory and imagination
            are not separate from each other, both are committed to going deeper
            into each other, and words are the key to the union between these
            two

          <p class="intro">
            "Alph@bet" is not 26 isolated/independent letters, where you can
            freely choose and combine code names (pronouns) that are memorable
            to you. It can be your family friend, your car, your pet's name, a
            book that has meaning to you, your nft (BAYC), your punk
            (cryptopunks)<br />
            Letters are just a tool to activate the mind. Their uniqueness is to
            find a way to feel intuitive and express (emotional) energy for
            everything in the world.<br />
            The vision is to build a type art community, to bring more attention
            to a niche and obscure profession, to support independent artists,
            to Perhaps the energy of individual letters may be limited, but the
            power of language (words) united by letters is infinite, and I hope
            that the community united by individual "we" can also do amazing
            things together.<br />
            And finally, bring diversity to the NFT community!

          <p class="intro">
            Hi, I'm kzizib and for the past 6 years I have been doing visual
            design and typography for brands. I've always been obsessed with the
            Fibonacci sequence and the grid system, which are the core tools of
            my creativity. I also have a wide range of interests and love
            solving puzzles.<br />I love all kinds of fonts from the traceable
            Sans-serif to the mysterious Egyptian symbols, which have always
            been magical to me. My teacher participated in the Morisawa Type
            Design Competition and won a gold medal (which always inspires me).
            I am forever learning.<br />Until the emergence of non-homogenized
            tokens, I knew something was going to change. As a designer I deeply
            believe that NFT is an effective way to provide real world benefits
            in a non-traditional way.
          </p>
          <img id="teamPic2" src="images/ryanPic.webp" alt="" />
          <p class="intro">
            I am Ryan. I am kzizib's college classmate, we studied together and
            did our graduation design together. After graduation, I have been
            working on painting. In my free time I finished my first novel and
            did the illustration by myself. In a sense I am a perfectionist. I
            can only upload my work if it meets the standards I think it should.
            So my output is not very efficient, less is more isn't it haha. In
            2020, I discovered the field of NFT and prepared for it, and now I
            can't wait for the adventures ahead!
